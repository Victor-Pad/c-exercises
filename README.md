# c-exercises
This is the start of my journey to break into Embedded Systems. 

Here I'll save exercises from CS50 and the book C Programming: A Modern Approach to help me learn the C language. 

Eventually, I'll add Advent of Code challenges.

#### Additional Notes:
After several months, I've completed chapter 20 of the book. Originally, I wanted to complete chapters 21 and 22, but due to time constraints, I decided to leave it at 20. 

Today, 7/22/2025, I'll start learning about microcontrollers with the STM32C071RB and finally kickstart the "hard" part of learning Embedded Systems.
